# Popular understanding of the Titanic catastrophe

## Introduction

Everyone knows that the Titanic sank, but there is generally little sense of the magnitude 
of the disaster. Here I compare some guesses of the total number of passengers that died 
to actual mortality statistics.


## Results

The vector representation of guesses at the total number of passengers that died is:


```{r}
guesses <- c(1,1,1)

```


I polled a total of `r length(guesses)` people. Their mean guess was `r mean(guesses)`. 

The actual number of deaths can be extracted from the Titanic R sample dataset as follows:

```{r}
actual <- apply(Titanic, c(4), sum)['No']

```
Giving a total of `r actual` deaths.

Here is a plot of the guesses versus the actual value:

```{r}
hist(guesses)
abline(v=actual,col=3,lty=3)

```


## Discussion


This subject clearly requires further study.
